## üìù Project Overview 

As part of my internship at CodTech, I completed Task 2: Deep Learning ‚Äì Image Classification, where I designed and implemented a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. The primary objective of this project was to build a functional image classification system capable of distinguishing between different types of images based on training data. To achieve this, I used Python 3.13 as the programming language and the PyTorch deep learning framework, along with Torchvision for efficient dataset handling and transformations. The development and execution of the model were carried out using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the code editor.

The dataset for this task was organized into two folders: one named cats containing 10 images of cats, and another named dogs containing 10 images of dogs. These images served as the training dataset for the model. Additionally, a separate folder named test_images was used to test the model's predictive performance after training. The model architecture was built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a widely used structure for image processing tasks. The training process was executed for 5 epochs, during which the model continuously improved its performance by minimizing the loss function. The final model achieved an accuracy of 75% on the small sample dataset.

After training, the model was able to correctly classify test images such as c11.jpeg as a cat and d11.jpeg as a dog, showcasing its ability to learn visual features and patterns. Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience in critical deep learning concepts such as defining model architecture, using data loaders, transforming image data, training and validating a model, and evaluating predictions.

This task provided practical exposure to the workflow of image classification and the use of PyTorch for developing deep learning models. Projects like this have significant real-world applications in fields such as medical image analysis, security and surveillance, animal species recognition, retail automation, and smartphone apps that rely on object recognition. The successful implementation of this task not only improved my understanding of neural networks and image data but also demonstrated how deep learning techniques can solve real-world problems efficiently and effectively.
